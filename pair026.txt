2/3

Ben

Informed that partner worked through a good portion of the code. 
Reviewed it, and offered several suggestions regarding a left boundary for the knight, 
as well as a more precise collision detection between the knight and the fireballs. 
Still contemplating ways to make the fireballs stagger and to make the dragon move along the top of the screen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam

Revised much of the code, got the basic level of it functional. Planning on improvements.
Removing bits of unneeded code.

Ben

he game is running smoothly. There is still a test in GameRunner that needs to be covered by Web-Cat.  
Possibility of adding a few more extra ideas to the game before final submission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam

More bug revision. Spoke with partner about potential fixes and applied those we could. Almost finished.
Once the dragon movement is done and collision detection fixed, the game is good to go.
Random testing also needs to be resolved. Awaiting e-mail response from Viera on that.
What is done so far has been submitted to Web-Cat with minor errors.
