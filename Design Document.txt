The Class Diagram is enclosed as "p026-diagram.png".

The active objects in the game world are the Knight, the Dragon, and the Fireballs.
The Dragon moves left and right between two points, hurling fireballs at the player from the background. It only moves on tick.
	The Fireballs themselves do not have any correlation to the dragon's location, at least at this moment.
The Fireballs fall vertically on tick and reappear with a random x-coordinate at a set height and begin to fall again once
	they hit the ground.
The Knight moves onKey and can only do so left and right. If a fireball comes into a certain distance of him,
	he loses a life and is put back at the left door. If the knight reaches the right door, five points are awarded to the player,
	and the knight is transported back to the left side of the game world. The game will end when either
	100 points are accumulated or the knight loses all three lives.

The score is displayed in the top left, and the amount of remaining lives in the top right.
