User Manual for Knight Helmet

You are a knight trying to save a princess. After enduring blistering winds and scorching deserts,
you finally reach it to realize there is a dragon guarding you. The dragon is hurling fireballs at you as you try
to cross an unreasonable amount of bridges to get to the princess. Luckily, your armor is strong enough
to endure three hits from the dragon's fire. When you get hit, however, you must return to the left tower
to recover from the damage.

The controls are the left and right arrows keys. Use them to run to the other side of the bridge and dodge incoming fireballs.
Once you reach the right tower door, you run through to realize you are at the leftside of another bridge.
When you get to the end of one bridge, you get 5 points. The game ends when your armor breaks, or when you reach 100 points.
